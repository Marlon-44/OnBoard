            The offer for your vehicle with license plate
            <strong th:text="${placa}">XXX000</strong> has been marked as
            <strong>out of service</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            This means your vehicle is currently unavailable on the platform and
            cannot be rented until its status is changed.
        </p>

        <img
